(02) Development Environment: Python 3.6 or later is necessary for coding the medical chatbot system.

(03) Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow for model training, HuggingFace for embeddings.

(04) NLP Libraries: LangChain and transformers for advanced conversational capabilities.

(05) Version Control: Git for collaborative development and effective code management.

(06) IDE: VS Code for coding, debugging, and version control integration.

(07) Additional Dependencies: scikit-learn, FAISS for vector storage, Fastapi for deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before you can start using the Llama2 Medical Bot, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required Python packages (you can install them using pip):
    - langchain
    - chainlit
    - sentence-transformers
    - faiss
    - PyPDF2 (for PDF document loading)

## Installation


1. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Download the required language models and data. Please refer to the Langchain documentation for specific instructions on how to download and set up the language model and vector store.

5. Set up the necessary paths and configurations in your project, including the `DB_FAISS_PATH` variable and other configurations as per your needs.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Llama2 Medical Bot, you need to:

1. Set up your environment and install the required packages as described in the Installation section.

2. Configure your project by updating the `DB_FAISS_PATH` variable and any other custom configurations in the code.

3. Prepare the language model and data as per the Langchain documentation.

4. Start the bot by running the provided Python script or integrating it into your application.

## Usage

The Llama2 Medical Bot can be used for answering medical-related queries. To use the bot, you can follow these steps:

1. Start the bot by running your application or using the provided Python script.

2. Send a medical-related query to the bot.

3. The bot will provide a response based on the information available in its database.

4. If sources are found, they will be provided alongside the answer.

5. The bot can be customized to return specific information based on the query and context provided.

## Results and Impact:
The Personalized Medical Chatbot enhances accessibility to medical information, reducing the burden on healthcare professionals while offering patients accurate, on-demand medical advice. The integration of advanced AI models ensures a smooth interaction with users, fostering a more inclusive and efficient healthcare environment.

This project lays the groundwork for future developments in AI-driven healthcare tools, aiming to improve patient outcomes and simplify medical assistance.
